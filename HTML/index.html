                <h3>Tech</h3>
                <p>Tech is a huge topic at this day and age and there’s so much to discuss. I love talking about new tech, new phones that came out recently, new pc parts and their improvements compared to the last generations, tech accessories and peripherals and so much more. I enjoyed building my desktop PC and enjoy taking care of it. I also love talking about software. Music, movies and games are also some of my interests that I like to include in this category.</p>

                <h3>Gym</h3>
                <p>I’ve been working out at the local Gym for a while now. I’m really enjoying the gym culture and I’ve been getting a lot of progress. Along the way I learnt a lot of tips and tricks and it’s turned into another passion of mine. I’m very proud of my progress and I’m not planning on quitting anytime soon! I think this is a hobby everyone should at least trying to get into because of all the benefits you get from it in the long term. Go try it out if you haven’t already!</p>

            <h3>School Projects</h3>
            <div class="proj">
                <h4>Graphics Skills</h4>
                <p>In the graphics skills classes we have learnt how to use Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. For both of these programs we’ve had a big assignment to test our skills. For Photoshop we had to make an advertisement. For Illustrator we had to remake a photo of a guy on a rocket ship! I enjoyed both of these assignments a lot!</p>

                <h4>UI Design</h4>
                <p>For UI Design we’ve had a pretty big project on our hands. We had to make a design for an app. Starting at a sketch, then we made a wireframe and after that we had to make a visual design. All of these assignments I made with my friends Bo, Lukas and Zoë. We’re very proud of what we have achieved. Our last assignment of this project is due the same day as this portfolio but luckily we were already very ahead of time for this assignment!</p>

            <h3>Workplace Learning 1</h3>
            <div class="proj">
                <h4>What is it?</h4>
                <p>Workplace learning is a subject where we are taught and prepared to exercise our future job. We get a whole lot of projects and had a few presentations shown to us where we learnt various things. This includes giving us information about personal branding or companies presenting themselves. It was all very interesting!</p>

            <div class="proj">
                <h4>Assignments</h4>
                <p>We had a few assignments, some bigger ones some smaller ones, some medium ones. The first few assignments were doing online tests about who we are, answering questions that were given to us like what our motivation is and what our soft and hard skills are. Or things that we value most in life. After that we had companies give us presentations and we had to take notes. With those notes we were tasked to make an essay. A few weeks later we were tasked to look at job offers online and observe them so we could explain in our own words what they include. Then we had to make a concept board for a dashboard, find inspiration first and then work on it in groups of 3. This was a bigger assignment then we initially realized it was but it went great! After that we were tasked to make this very Portfolio. This is by far my favorite assignment of them all because of the scale but also the fact that I have to do this on my own and I can be creative.</p>
